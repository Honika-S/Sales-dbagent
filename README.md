# Database Query Chatbot

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with data stored in MongoDB using natural language queries. The chatbot can retrieve records, generate summaries, and create reports based on user inputs. It allows users to query data from a MongoDB database and receive detailed answers generated by the LLaMA model from Ollama.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For creating the web application.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **MongoDB**: As the database for storing and retrieving Airbnb listings data.
- **LangChain**: For handling embeddings and LLaMA model interactions.
- **Sentence Transformers**: To generate embeddings for text queries and descriptions.


## Set Up MongoDB

To connect the application to MongoDB, follow these steps:

1. **Create a MongoDB Account**:
   - Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Once logged in, create a new cluster by following the prompts (choose the free tier for testing).

3. **Create a Database**:
   - After your cluster is set up, navigate to the **Database** section and create a new database named `sample_airbnb`.

4. **Add Collections**:
   - Within the `sample_airbnb` database, create a collection named `listingsAndReviews`.

5. **Add Sample Data**:
   - Insert sample data into the `listingsAndReviews` collection. You can find sample Airbnb data online or create your own documents.

6. **Get Connection URI**:
   - Click on the **Connect** button in your cluster dashboard.
   - Choose **Connect your application**.
   - Copy the connection string (URI) provided and replace `<username>` and `<password>` with your MongoDB Atlas username and password. Ensure the `retryWrites=true&w=majority` part is included.

## Ensure Up-to-Date Libraries
1.Outdated dependencies could cause compatibility issues. Update your libraries, especially langchain, by running:
pip install --upgrade langchain pymongo sentence-transformers
